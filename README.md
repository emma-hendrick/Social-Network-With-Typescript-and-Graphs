# Overview

I built a simple social network framework here in order to both develop my knowledge of typescript (strongly typed languages for the win!) and in order to learn about the graph data structure.

# Development Environment

This software was developed using typescript, and makes use of the prompt-sync library.

# Future Work

- Allow multiple users with the same names, likely by either adding user names, or GUIDs
- Figure out how to allow Ctrl-c from the prompt, as having Ctrl-c interrupt that just feels wrong
